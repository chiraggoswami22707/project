# Date Range Filter Implementation Plan

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### âœ… 1. Update Maintenance Dashboard Export Functionality
- **File**: `src/app/maintenance-dashboard/page.js`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Updated the `handleExportSubmit` function to use `filterFromDate` and `filterToDate` instead of the old `filterDate` variable
  - Fixed the Firestore query logic to handle date range filtering properly
  - The function now correctly applies both "from" and "to" date constraints when building the query

### âœ… 2. Verify the Implementation
- **Status**: Code review completed - the implementation correctly handles date range filtering for Excel exports
- **Functionality**: Users can now select both start and end dates for filtering complaints in the export feature

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps
- Test the functionality in the browser to ensure the date range filtering works correctly
- Verify that the Excel export includes only complaints within the selected date range
- Ensure the UI components (Calendar selectors) work properly with the updated logic

## ðŸ“‹ Testing Checklist
- [ ] Select a "From Date" and export - should include complaints from that date onward
- [ ] Select a "To Date" and export - should include complaints up to that date
- [ ] Select both "From Date" and "To Date" - should include complaints within that range
- [ ] Export without date filters - should include all complaints
- [ ] Verify Excel file contains correct date-filtered data
